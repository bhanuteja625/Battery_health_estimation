# Battery_health_estimation

This project is aimed at estimating the state of health of the battery using machineleanring techniques such as DNN, CNN, simpleRNN, GRU, LSTM.

The file Model.ipynb consists of all the data preprocessing modules and ML models used in the project. The weights of the Ml models are saved in .H5 format so that the
weights can be easily loaded and used.
